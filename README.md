# Posted Speed Limit
An optimized speed limit script for FiveM forked from [Posted-Speedlimit](https://github.com/Big-Yoda/Posted-Speedlimit).  

The original version of this script was causing performance issues in-game, therefore I decided to optimize it and make it more efficient. Using [Superzorik's](https://github.com/supazorik) team of Villagers in Minecraft (No joke, we used Minecraft to optimize this script for the hell of it), we were able to optimize the script to be more efficient and stable.
  
## Features
- Optimized speed limit script.
- Configurable.
- Up-to-date practices. (Rather than depreciated files)
  
## In-Game Example

## Installation
1. Download the latest release.
2. Drag Posted-Speedlimit into your resource folder.
3. Go to your server.cfg, and write "start Posted-Speedlimit"

That's it! If everything goes correctly, the next time you load into your server, you will see the speed limit on your screen.
